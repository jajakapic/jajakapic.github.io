Every powder room must be ventilated by either a window that opens or a fan. There is a small two piece powder room (5�6 x 5�6) off of the kitchen which i would also like to continue with the hardwood. We�re getting ready to renovate our kitchen and have decided to put in the same hardwood flooring as we have in the adjoining dining room. White and silver transitional powder room boasts a nickel and marble 2 leg washstand placed on dark wood floors and fitted with a polished nickel cross handle faucet positioned beneath an oval beaded mirror mounted on a white board and batten trim accented by silver wallpaper illuminated by a nickel sconce adorning a white shade.
