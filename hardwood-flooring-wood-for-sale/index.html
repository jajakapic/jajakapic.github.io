Series Woods 10mm Laminate Flooring Harvest Oak From ukflooringdirect.co.uk
A hardwood or bamboo veneer, top layer, will typically be 0.5mm to 6mm or more in thickness. We carry hardwood flooring, laminate, bamboo, cork, vinyl, area rugs and even staircase materials like iron balusters.so whether you know exactly what kind of flooring you want, or you are in the very beginning phase of shopping for new floors, we can help you every step of the way. With a thicker veneer, it allows the floor to be refinished during the lifespan of the floor. However, when refinishing prefinished flooring, it is necessary to remove a lot more wood to achieve a level floor, so you will lose more life of the floor in the first refinish than with a unfinished ipe floor that was finished on site.
