Baby bouncer / baby walker / bumbo chair in Morpeth, Northumberland From gumtree.com
Limit time in the bouncer chair to about 20 or 30 minutes at a time. It�s safe to buy baby wraps and carriers; This gives your baby a bit more freedom to do as the name suggests — jump. I dont see anything wrong with baby bouncers at all if its going to keep her amused and im sure they are safe , my own dds had them well 1 had a swing other had a bouncer and they loved it and if you live in a small flat like i do then you are never going to be that far away from her.
