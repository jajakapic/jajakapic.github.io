I�m a bit confused as i presumed once your teen hit their 18th birthday their child benefit stopped even if they were in their 2nd year of sixth form/college. To get the child benefit extension your child must not be working more than 23 hours a week and you must apply within three months of them leaving education or training. .</p>

<p>To get the child benefit extension your child must not be working more than 23 hours a week and you must apply within three months of them leaving education or training. However, my 2nd daughter turned 18 last november 2016 and is still receiving child benefit. Child benefit stops when the extension period ends or when your child turns 18, whichever comes first. .</p>

You will still get child benefit for the entire quarter, in which your child turns 18 (unless your child turns 18 on the first day of the quarter).your last child benefit payment will be made after the end of the quarter as usual. If your child is 18 on the first day of the quarter, you will not receive any child benefit for that quarter. .</p>
