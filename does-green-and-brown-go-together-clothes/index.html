<p>So wearing a blue and green outfit might come as a shock to some people. It�s partially true (walnut doesn�t look good with dark charcoal), but the vast majority of grey + brown combinations look terrific. A head to toe red &amp; green had a lot of chances of looking like some tacky outfit for a xmas party. Does green and brown go well together?</p>

<p>There is this oddly persistant belief that a guy can�t wear brown shoes with a grey suit, pants, or trousers. Opt for blue pants and add an orange top or choose a piece that mixes the perfect blend of both colours. Don’t be afraid to mix colors as you want it and look stylish, elegant, and gorgeous!

<p>Green is a secondary color, a combination of the two primary colors blue and yellow. Colorful scarves may be the popular choice currently, but i think a neutral option can act as the perfect winter staple. Essentially, blue and orange are on opposite sides of this colour wheel, which means they contrast strongly but complement each other as they do it.
