What Color Floors Go With Grey Walls Sofa Cope From sofacope.com
We have warm, natural oak hardwood floors that we are not in a position to refinish in the near future. For example, if you have white maple, light brown oak, or ash brown flooring, you can pair it with cool wall shades like pale blue or grey, while walnut or beech hardwood floors are best combined with warm wall colors such as pale yellow or beige. When paired with the right wood floor, greige walls can create a cozy and even calming interior. While all wood has warm undertones, the color and how light or dark the wood is determines the color of gray wall paint that works with it.
