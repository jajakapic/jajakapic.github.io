Actually, this is one of the reasons that many large areas covered in ceramic tile crack over time. For very wide more permanent gapping, gluing rope with a urethane adhesive between boards has been successful. These abnormal gaps occur due to expansion and contraction as a result of environmental changes. Whenever hardwood flooring is being installed, an expansion gap of at least 12mm needs to be left around the perimeter of the room (including doorways).
