Actually, this is one of the reasons that many large areas covered in ceramic tile crack over time. For very wide more permanent gapping, gluing rope with a urethane adhesive between boards has been successful. These abnormal gaps occur due to expansion and contraction as a result of environmental changes. Whenever hardwood flooring is being installed, an expansion gap of at least 12mm needs to be left around the perimeter of the room (including doorways).

If no expansion gap has been left, when a floor naturally expands it will have no where to go and will raise up and damage the flooring.
