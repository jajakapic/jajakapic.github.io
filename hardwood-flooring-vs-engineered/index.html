Engineered hardwood is more resilient to these changes due to its structural stability. Engineered wood flooring is made up of high quality plywood that lies beneath a layer of solid wood on the surface. Engineered floors with a thin veneer typically cannot be refinished, however, many modern engineered wood floors are made with a thicker veneer that makes refinishing possible.
