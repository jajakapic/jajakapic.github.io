Vinyl flooring uses a high definition photographic print on top of synthetic material to create a realistic floor look. It’s available in a range of colors, including gray, brown, beige, reddish, and black, with the color of the flooring depending on the wood variety used by the manufacturer. Soft flooring refers to carpet, whereas hard flooring includes hardwood, vinyl, laminate and hybrid options. When it comes to rvs, however, use vinyl flooring throughout for a cohesive feel.
