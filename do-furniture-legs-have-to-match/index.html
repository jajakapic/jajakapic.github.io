<p>I’m here to tell you…matching furniture is boring. You don’t need to match bar stools with dining chairs entirely. They’re great quality and come as bare wood so once i refinish the dressers i can stain the legs to match. Couch legs are really necessary, when you got bored of your couch, you can remove the legs and use it for a short period of time, you will feel the discomfort after few days, you can test it if yo need, but if you have a elder in your home, please do avoid it, it will destroy their comfort.</p>
