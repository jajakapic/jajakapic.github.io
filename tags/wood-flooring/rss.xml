My New Wood Floor Is In. I Hate Glue Down Floors From contractortalk.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid hardwood floors must be fixed into position by either gluing or nailing down to the subfloor. The glue down method of laying hardwood floors is one of the original methods of installing hardwood flooring. Once you have decided to use the glue down floor method, make sure that you leave a large enough expansion gap, depending on the hardwood product you chose, from the wall to allow the wood to contract and expand. While both of these methods get the job done, you need to read up on gluing vs nailing hardwood floors prior to installation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool Cost Of Hardwood Flooring Vs Carpet With Cheap Price&lt;/strong&gt;, Laminate is an affordable flooring option for homeowners who prefer an alternative to carpet but want to avoid the cost of hardwood or tiles. While today’s carpeting offers decent stain resistance and steam cleaners can do a great job removing stains, you can still end up with permanent carpet stains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of installation is higher than most other floors because it does require a professional. With more styles, colors and textures to choose from, not to mention pile height, brand and various treatments (stain guard, etc.) carpet is a flooring option that really can’t go wrong. You can certainly install carpet tiles yourself, saving on any costs associated with installation. Hardwood looks great and it’s incredibly easy to clean with a broom and a mop, but it has a higher initial cost than carpet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
