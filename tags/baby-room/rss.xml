&lt;p&gt;In most cases a coach seat is 16 inches wide, so your car seat must be this width at a maximum. Foldable strollers are allowed and no charge. If you have a child under six months, i would suggest maybe a baby wrap or sling would be easier.

&lt;p&gt;In this room below, i ran the long side of the tile parallel to the wood floor and entrance to the room, because of the direction one would be looking at the open kitchen from the living room and how one would be using the kitchen. Homeowners should select hard surface flooring that is capable of withstanding moisture. Sometimes the layout has to do with how you would look at the room, or where the main focus is in room, not where the entrance is. Hardwood floors are preferred by others who enjoy the homely, warm glow of a hardwax oil floor finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
