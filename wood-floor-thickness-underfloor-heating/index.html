While there are no rules for the thickness of the wood you can use with underfloor heating, we recommend that wood thickness should be no more than 18mm as any thicker than this will hinder the efficient performance of the heating system. Thick wooden floors will reduce the amount of heat passing from the heated slab underneath to the room. However, how efficiently you install underfloor heating will depend on the wooden flooring and the temperatures the floor heating system can reach. How much heat will get through the floor?
