The cost of new wood floors ranges from $6 to $13 per square foot while engineered hardwood is slightly more expensive at an average of $6 to $15 per square foot for both materials and installation. In addition to the product, we offer services such as installation (including moving furniture, removing and disposing of old flooring and borders and trims), as well as stair accessories. Installation should cost $30 to $40 per square metre, including the underlay. All of our hard floors are priced per square metre.
