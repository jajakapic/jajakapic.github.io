<h3 id="my-hardwood-floor-is-8-years-old-and-is-flaking-and-peeling">My Hardwood Floor Is 8 Years Old And Is Flaking And Peeling.</h3><p>Mop and glow is one of them. After 15 years, no flaking. I had them recently recoated and the coating is peeling off. That chipping and scraping off, even delaminating, is the result.</p>

Adhesion is attained between coats by applying a coat of polyurethane, allowing it to dry and then thoroughly buffing or abrading the coating with a fine abrasive.

I have had this problem one other time in the 4 years that i have been sanding floors. It kind of looks like pulling up a piece of clear tape. It�s better to have to paint on extra coats that will actually dry, than to saturate the floor with a coat that doesn�t dry, which will lead to your polyurethane peeling again.</p>
