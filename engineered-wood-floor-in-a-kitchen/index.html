For �lacquered�, i remember i read somewhere the edges between the planks need to be sealed with transparent silicon to prevent water from getting into the gaps and damaging. Laminate is generally a first choice as it is inert, but doesn�t look as good. Plus, with a resistance to changes in humidity, they’re less likely to warp or buckle in a room where water is just a part of life, making the lifecore hardwood collection a great choice for the kitchen. Dishware may well survive falls onto hardwood flooring, but at the same time, a dropped can of vegetables could dent the wood.
