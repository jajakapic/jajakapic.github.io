face nails for hardwood floors Flooring Ideas Tag From pinterest.com
The proper way to face nail is to countersink the nails with a nail punch and fill the remaining hole with coordinating wood putty. Nails should be driven into the top surface of strips and counter sunk (face nailing). You should be in a good position to use nails that do not have heads in order to ensure that they slightly sink beneath the wood surface and do not hinder the tight form when installing the other planks to form a strong wooden floor. The wall coverings and painting should be completed before you nail down hardwood flooring.
