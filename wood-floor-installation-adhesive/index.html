Glue Wood Flooring to a Concrete Slab Fine Homebuilding From finehomebuilding.com
Glue down hardwood floors is a good solution for large, open areas, where footsteps and drumming noise needs to be minimised. Adhesives are most commonly used with engineered wood flooring installed over concrete, as well as parquet installed over a slab or plywood. Therefore, after laying the solid wood floor and allowing time for the selected adhesive to cure, the wood is sanded and finished in a series of steps. With the advanced vapor barriers on the market today that reduce vapor transmission through concrete slabs, more adhesives are being used to glue down solid wood flooring.
