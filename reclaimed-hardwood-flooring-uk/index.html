Reclaimed Wood From reclaimedflooringco.com
Reclaimed wood flooring may use floorboards that are cut from thicker factory timbers, from the exterior siding of a barn or from the joists that supported the stories of an old building. We have a large and diverse stock, with wood types such as maple, beech, oak, mahogany, pine etc. Established in 1990, we sell to both domestic and commercial clients in the uk and worldwide. But anyone who loves wood will testify, to see old, usable wood going to waste is an environmental and moral.
