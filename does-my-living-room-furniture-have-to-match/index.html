In addition to mixing and matching materials, incorporate a variety of shapes and sizes of furniture into your bedroom, too, backstein advises. The furnishings don�t need to match in a living room, they need to harmonize with one another. Matching furniture is a good option for a timeless and classic decorating style.</p>
