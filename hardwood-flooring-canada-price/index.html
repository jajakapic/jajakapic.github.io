<p>These floors have a natural beauty to them that cannot be understated. Solid hardwood gets its name from the fact that this type of flooring is made up of just hardwood. Engineered hardwood floors are made with 100% real solid wood for their top layer, while using thin layers of derivitive wood products (such as plywood) for the middle layers. With solid hardwood flooring, prices start at around $8.00 per square foot, including materials and the average labor cost although it largely depends on the species and thickness of the flooring.</p>
