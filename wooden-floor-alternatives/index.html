Make Them Wonder Another Wood floor alternative From makethemwonderblog.blogspot.ca

The lumber can be stained the same color as the flooring, or a shade that is lighter or darker to blend in with the flooring. There are plenty of hardwood floor alternatives available today but none will give you the beauty and durability of hardwood flooring.
