In apartment buildings, i sometimes hear people walking around on their wood floors above us when they are wearing high heels/boots/dress shoes, especially when they are on their way in.

Therefore, if the hardwood floors are in the upstairs part of your house and you have access to them, you’ll get better results by treating the upstairs floor rather than treating the downstairs ceiling.
