How many coats of polyurethane on wood floors From iammrfoster.com
A few days after staining, i applied a coat of minwax oil based polyurethane (satin finish). Some finishers offer lower estimates for two coats, but your floor won’t have the same level of protection, and scratches will go through to the wood more easily. Of course, this will depend on the type of polyurethane you are using. Since the need for multiple coats has been established, the next question would be “how long do i have to wait between coats of polyurethane?” it is always necessary to let each coat of polyurethane get dry before.
