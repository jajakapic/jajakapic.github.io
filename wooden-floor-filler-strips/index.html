Filler strips are essentially very fine batons of the same species and colour of wood as your floor that you insert into the gaps.

If wood filler is applied prematurely between the strips on dry flooring, the material will be pushed up through the gaps when the floor picks up moisture and expands. As for the gaps between planks, if they are quite large, perhaps you can rip some thin strips of pine on a good table saw to bang into the gaps.
