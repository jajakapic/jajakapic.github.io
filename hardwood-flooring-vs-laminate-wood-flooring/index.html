Generally, hardwood is considerably higher to buy and to install. However, if you consider the price, laminate is way better than hardwood. Laminate laminate flooring comes from composite wood that�s pressed together at heated temperatures. Laminate flooring, which is made of a synthetic fiberboard material and has a laminate finish, is much cheaper than hardwood but will not last as long.
